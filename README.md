# ncc

This repository contains the C++ compiler that featured in SDT 2.11a.
It is archived here mainly for historical interest and is not expected to
build with contemporary tools (originally it ran on Windows 98) without
additional engineering effort.

_Special thanks to LDS for assisting in its release._
